* Jupyter Notebook.
* Pandas Library.
* Numpy Library.

* matplotlib.pyplot library.
# Project Motivation:
Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be just an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy _one_ get_ one_ free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.
I prefer goal here to help Starbucks make all users receive same offer. To solve this challenge we need to answer two important questions:
1- What is the offer should be sent to the customer? 
2- What is the best offers for each demographic groups ?
# File Descriptions:
* Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb

* train_df

* test_df
For test later records.
